# DOM 101

In this section we will shed the light on some important properties and methods provided by the DOM API that will help us working with forms using JavaScript.

## HTMLFormElement

The `HTMLFormElement` interface represents a `<form>` element in the DOM.

### Properties

This interface inherit properties from `HTMLElement` as well as other specific ones.

* `HTMLFormElement.elements` returns a collection holding all *form controls* in this form. Check what form controls mean below
* `HTMLFormElement.length` returns the length of all form controls in this form.

#### Elements that are considered form controls

Some elements are omitted for simplicity

* `button`
* `fieldset`
* `input`
* `select`
* `textarea`

This is the preferred way to get the important form elements when working with forms.

### Methods

This interface inherit properties from `HTMLElement` as well as other specific ones.

- `checkValidity()`

- `reportValidity()`

- `requestSubmit()`

- `reset()`

  Resets the form to its initial state. Check the note below about how the initial state is defined. 

- `submit()`

  Submits the form to the server.

#### Form's initial state

The form initial state is defined in the HTML attributes rather than the DOM properties. It differs according to the type of element.

* `<input>` is defined by the `value` attribute.
* `<textarea>` is defined by the inner text written within the starting and closing tags.
* `<select>` is defined by the `option` tags that has the `selected` attribute.

### Events

* `formdata` fires every time we call `new FormData()` on a `<form>`. It can be used to construct data and submit it asynchronously. ðŸ’£ This is relatively a new event and it's not supported in Safari yet.
* `reset` fires when the form is reset.
* `submit` fires when the form is being submitted. Usually authors attach listeners to it and stop the submission to manipulate data, submit the form asynchronously or do many other things
