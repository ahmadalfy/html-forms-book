# HTML Forms

This is my attempt to write a book about a topic I learned a lot about during my career. Forms are everywhere on the web. This is why I dedicate that book to go through everything about them.

This work is in a very early stage, I don't expect it to be complete before at least 6 months. There is a lot I am intending to cover, hopefully that end up beneficial to anyone.
